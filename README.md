👋 Hi, I’m Florencia

I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in electronics engineering and systems architecture.
My background includes low-level programming, hardware fundamentals, and control systems—knowledge that shapes how I approach building scalable, efficient software.

I’ve worked with Python for automation, scripting, and backend tasks, and with React to build modern, maintainable interfaces. 
My experience also includes technical project management, MVP development, and collaborating with cross-functional teams in startup environments.

🛠️ Core Skills & Tools:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C (basic)
- Frameworks: React, Node.js, Vite
- Tools: Git, Supabase, Notion, Trello, Figma
- Concepts: Agile workflows, system design, low-level architecture, data modeling

🧩 What sets me apart:
- Engineering mindset with practical coding skills
- Ability to translate business goals into technical decisions
- Experience leading MVP projects from idea to deployment
- Strong communication across technical and non-technical teams

📬 Currently open to full-time or freelance roles in software development, especially in early-stage products or technically challenging environments.
